    "Besides, the wide resnet model size can be modified easily with the width factor be the dominating  factor (e.g. 6 -> 4 reduce the model size approximately by a factor of 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this model allows me to explore the effect between depth and width of the network as well as the standard ResNet architecture, the idea of residual blocks is founded used widely e.g. in Efficientnet and other models.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Wide ResNet \n",
    "This model is primarily used to compare the effect of width vs depth.\n",
    "Below is quote from the author of the wide resnet paper:\n",
    "very deep residual network has a problem of diminishing feature reuse which makes it slow to train. This architecture decreases the depth and increases the width of residual blocks\n",
    "dropout could regularize the model and prevent overfitting, dropout in residual networks was studied previously to have a negative effect when used in the identity part of the block. \n",
    "In the wide ResNet, the author argues that dropout should be inserted between convolutional layers instead of within the identity part of the blocks.\n",

    "# Parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning rate \n",
    "It is adjusted during the training based on the convergence in each 10 epoch, if the improvement after one 10 epoch is significantly less than the previous, then the learning rate is decreased by 10 times manually as what the typical learning rate decay does.\n",
    "Increases/decreases 80% is also tried to check whether the model is stucked at a local minimum and step size too big\n",
    "## weight decay\n",
    "it is initially set as 5e-4 compared with the standard 1.5e-4 to avoid overfitting\n",
    "once closer to 95%, it is adjusted slightly to ensure the model can continue to learn\n",
    "## drop out\n",
    "drop out = 0.5 is considered to be a bit high and the model stops improving at 91%.\n",
    "drop out = 0.3 still seems to stop the model from improving from 96%\n",
    "drop out = 0.1 \n",
    "The reason could be some less important but still crucial feature with less weight is constantly dropped and cause the model to stop learning\n",
    "## train_val_split\n",
    "0.8 - is used initially to testify the model selection \n",
    "0.95 is used once the model converged and stop improving\n",
    "## Early stopping\n",
    "It is found that it gives up to 2% improvement if the model is stopped early when the testing accuracy does not improve much anymore.\n",
    "kernel size of first convolution layer and image size\n",
    "the bottleneck of the time complexity is the ratio between the size of the image vs the kernel size of the first convolution layer\n",
    "Since the size needs to match with the input size, so only a certain set of kernel + padding+ stride combo can be used based on the formula\n",
    "## batch size\n",
    "smaller batch size could have the effect of regularising and based on experiment 96 is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## width factor\n",
    "width of 6 can give 99.48% in the test set but around 95% in submission and so it is reduced as it is thought to overfit since the model is too complex\n",
    "width of 2 is found not learning at the end\n",
    "## depth\n",
    "depth of 12 is found to learn exceptionally slow at the end\n",
    "# Notes from the Paper:\n",
    "increasing both depth and width helps until the number of parameters becomes too high and stronger regularization is needed\n",
    "widening consistently improves performance across residual networks of different depth;\n",
    "# Implementation\n",
    " \n",
    "Follow from the original paper \"use SGD with Nesterov momentum and cross-entropy loss, the initial learning rate is set to 0.1, weight decay to 0.0005, momentum to 0.9\"\n",
    "Minibatch size = 96\n",
    "the test set from train_test_split is used as an indicator of improvement and generalisation of the network, however, this does not guarantee the \n",
    "Observation\n",
    "Adam could be better than SGD for resnet50, with more than 5% faster convergence\n",
    "Future Improvement\n",
    "cutMix, learning rate scheduler are some examples of data augmentation that may improve the result, ZCA whitening as mentioned in the paper.\n",
