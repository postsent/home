At the **late** stage, the represenatation could not be improved due to the **limitation** of:  \n",

I think further training may lead to overfitting issue that make the model less generalise. And so early stopping at 100 epoch is applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lr = 1e-3 is chosen**. This is because this lr helps the model to achieve a reasonable f1 score given the small dataset and the simple model. The smaller learning rate is not considered as it converges too slowly. As seen from below, it is at 0.52 f1 score after 150 epoch compared to 0.65. And the smaller one, if **continues this trend** of learning (epoch 130 ~ 150 improve by 0.02), would take about (0.65 - 0.52) / 0.02 * (150-130) = 130 epoch more to reach 0.65 score though this is likely to be a bad estimation.\n"
