💎 8:  group by phrases and counting the unique doc id for later calculate rdf: 
[(&#39;assign sell lease&#39;, (1, &#39;rdf&#39;))]

💎 9:  Get all unique candidate phrases, -1 as dummpy to form key value pair: 
[(&#39;assign sell lease&#39;, -1)]

💎 10:  For later edf calculation, join the top 4 phrase list with the unqiue phrase, then group by phrase: 
[(&#39;assign sell lease&#39;, [(&#39;0-0&#39;, -1)])]

💎 11:  The input data-ready for calculating ess: 
[(&#39;assign sell lease&#39;, ((1, &#39;edf&#39;), (1, &#39;rdf&#39;)))]

💎 12:  💎 Essentiality Score Calculation:   Desire output format: 
[(&#39;assign sell lease&#39;, 1, 1, 1.0)]
